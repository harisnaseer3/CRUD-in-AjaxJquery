Complete CRUD in Laravel using Ajax


I have Implemented AJAX CRUD operation in laravel. 
To use AJAX in Laravel, you need to import a jquery library in your view file to use ajax functions of jquery, which will be used to send and receive data using ajax from the server. 
On the server-side, you can use the response() function to send the response to the client, and to send a response in JSON format, you can chain the response function with the JSON() function.
